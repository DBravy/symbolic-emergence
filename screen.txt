# Screen Quick Reference

## What is Screen?
Screen creates persistent terminal sessions that keep running even when you disconnect from SSH.

## Essential Commands

### Start a new session
```bash
screen -S session_name
```

### Detach from current session (keeps it running)
```
Ctrl+A, then press D
```

### List all running sessions
```bash
screen -ls
```

### Reattach to a session
```bash
screen -r session_name
```

### Kill a session
```bash
screen -X -S session_name quit
```

## Common Workflow

1. SSH into your server
2. `screen -S training_app`
3. Start your program (e.g., `python web_app.py`)
4. Detach: `Ctrl+A, D`
5. Close terminal/laptop - program keeps running
6. Later: SSH back in and `screen -r training_app`

## Key Points

- Programs in screen sessions survive SSH disconnections
- Closing terminal without detaching is fine - screen auto-detaches
- Perfect for long-running processes like training ML models
- If you forget session names, use `screen -ls` to see all sessions
