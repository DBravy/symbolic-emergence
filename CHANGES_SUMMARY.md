# Summary of Changes: Single Puzzle Reconstruction Training

## Overview
Modified the single puzzle training feature in the web app to use reconstruction training instead of selection training, and added visualization of the reconstructed output.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/train_single_puzzle.py` ‚úèÔ∏è
**Major changes:**
- Replaced selection-based training loop with reconstruction training
- Both agents now encode inputs and decode to reconstruct outputs
- Bidirectional training: A1‚ÜíA2 and A2‚ÜíA1
- Added reconstruction evaluation at test time
- Status file now includes reconstruction results with grids and accuracy

**Key code changes:**
- Lines 180-267: New reconstruction training loop
- Lines 269-337: New reconstruction-based testing with output capture
- Added `accuracy` variable initialization
- Saves reconstruction data to JSON status file

### 2. `templates/arc_single_puzzle.html` ‚úèÔ∏è
**Major changes:**
- Added new "Reconstruction Results" section
- Added `displayReconstruction()` JavaScript function
- Modified `updateStatus()` to show reconstruction when complete
- Uses existing `renderGrid()` for consistent ARC color display

**Key code changes:**
- Lines 121-126: New HTML section for reconstruction results
- Lines 391-431: New `displayReconstruction()` function
- Lines 362-365: Auto-display reconstruction when training completes

### 3. `web_app.py` ‚è∏Ô∏è
**No changes required!** 
- Existing status polling works with new format
- `/api/status` endpoint already handles the updated status file

## What's Different for Users

### Before:
1. Select puzzle ‚Üí Train ‚Üí See selection accuracy (%)
2. No visual output, just "correct/incorrect"

### After:
1. Select puzzle ‚Üí Train ‚Üí See reconstruction accuracy (%)
2. **Visual output**: Three grids showing test input, expected output, and reconstructed output
3. Can see exactly what patterns the agents learned to communicate

## Technical Details

### Training Approach
- **Old**: Selection from candidates (classification task)
- **New**: Reconstruction from scratch (generation task)

### Loss Function
- **Old**: Cross-entropy over candidate selection
- **New**: Cross-entropy over pixel predictions

### Metrics
- **Old**: Selection accuracy (did agent pick correct candidate?)
- **New**: Reconstruction accuracy (how many pixels correct?)

### Output Format
- **Old**: Binary correct/incorrect + probabilities
- **New**: Full grid reconstruction + pixel-wise accuracy

## Benefits

1. **Interpretability**: See what agents actually learned
2. **Debugging**: Identify learning vs memorization
3. **Better Training**: More direct learning objective
4. **Visual Feedback**: Easy to understand results
5. **Research Value**: Can analyze learned patterns

## Testing Status

‚úÖ Syntax validated
‚úÖ Python compilation successful
‚úÖ HTML template structure correct
‚úÖ Documentation complete
‚è≥ Runtime testing pending (requires PyTorch environment)

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Start web app: `python web_app.py`
2. Navigate to Single Puzzle page
3. Select puzzle (e.g., "007bbfb7")
4. Train for 50-100 cycles
5. View reconstruction results
6. Expected: 30-80% accuracy depending on puzzle complexity

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing features
‚úÖ Web app routing unchanged
‚úÖ Other training modes unaffected
‚úÖ Status file format extended (not replaced)
